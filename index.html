    <center><h1 style="color:red; font-family:cursive;">SEVEN WONDERS OF WORLD</h1></center>
    <font size="4" ><p align="justify"></p>The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, also known as the Seven Wonders of the World or simply the Seven Wonders,
        is a list of seven notable structures present during classical antiquity.
        The first known list of seven wonders dates back to the 2nd–1st century BC.<br>
        
        While the entries have varied over the centuries, the seven traditional wonders are the Great Pyramid of Giza,
        the Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Temple of Artemis, 
        the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. <br>Using modern-day countries, 
        two of the wonders were located in Greece, two in Turkey, two in Egypt, and one in Iraq. Of the seven wonders,
        only the Pyramid of Giza, which is also by far the oldest of the wonders, remains standing,
        while the others have been destroyed over the centuries. 
        There is scholarly debate over the exact nature of the Hanging Gardens, and there is doubt as to whether they existed at all.</p></font>

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">The Colosseum, Rome, Italy:</h3>
    <font size="4"><p>The Roman Colosseum made the modern-day list of seven world wonders. 
        We look into just a handful of the reasons why it is so popular today.
        n 225 BCE, Greek engineer, physicist and writer Philo of Byzantium compiled the famed original Seven Wonders of the World, a list of marvels, or “things to be seen,” across the ancient world.
        Since that time, many of these incredible artefacts no longer exist. But in 2007 a Swiss Foundation called the New7Wonders made a new list of seven wonders for the modern world. 
        On that list is the Roman Colosseum, an incredible feat of engineering that takes us all the way back to the Roman Empire. 
        Let’s look through the many reasons why the Roman Colosseum remains one of the most fascinating monuments in the history of human civilization.</p></font>

        <h3 style="color:darkorange;">The Great Wall of China:</h3>  
        <font size="4"><p>The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of miles along China’s historic northern border.
        Created over millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to the 7th century BCE,
        built as protective barriers against nomadic raids. 
        In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang masterminded the unification of all China’s walls into one almighty barrier,
        strengthening and extending the wall to keep out northern invaders. 
        Today, the wall is recognized as one of the seven wonders, which, including all its branches, measures a whopping 13,171 miles.

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">The Taj Mahal, India:</h3> 
    <font size="4"><p>India’s renowned Taj Mahal (Persian for Crown of Palaces) is the stunning white marble mausoleum 
        on the bank of the Yamuna River in the city of Agra, and it has been selected as one of the seven wonders of the world.
        Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built the temple as a tomb for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal,
        who died during childbirth in 1631. A marble tomb in the center is surrounded by 42 acres of grounds,
        where gardens, a mosque, a guest house, and a pool complete the complex. 
        The entire project took over 22 years to complete by 20,000 workers at a cost of 32 million rupees (around US$827 million by today’s standards). 
        But the hard work paid off – today, the Taj Mahal is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a vital component of India’s rich Mughal history.

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">Christ the Redeemer, Brazil:</h3> 
    <font size="4"><p>The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over Rio de Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado. 
        At 30 meters tall, this monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. 
        This huge public artwork was designed by the Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski in the 1920s and completed by
         Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer Albert Caquot in 1931.
        Made from reinforced concrete clad in over 6 million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer 
        is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Built just after the end of the First World War, 
        the sculpture was an overpowering symbol of Christianity and hope when the world had been brought to its knees, so it is no surprise that this 
        monument made the list of today’s seven wonders.

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">Machu Picchu, Peru:</h3> 
    <font size="4"><p>Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discovered high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian Sacred Valley. 
        Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact, featuring evidence of former
         plazas, temples, agricultural terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe the citadel was built as an estate 
         for the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 in polished drystone walls. 
         The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for millennia before being brought 
         to public attention by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. Because of this remarkable preservation, it is recognized today as one of the seven wonders.

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">Chichén Itzá, Mexico:</h3>
    <font size="4"><p>Deep in the Mexican state of Yucatán lies Chichen Itza, a historic Mayan city built between 
        the 9th and 12th centuries. Constructed by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itzá, the city includes
        a series of monuments and temples. The most celebrated is El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan.
        It is a huge step pyramid in the center of the city which was built as a devotional temple to the god Kukulkan. 
        In total, the entire temple features 365 steps, one for each day of the year. Even more impressively, 
        during the spring and summer equinoxes, the afternoon sun casts triangular shadows down the pyramid’s north stairway that 
        resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface, heading towards a stone snake head at the base – no wonder it is one of the seven wonders today!

    <h3 style="color:darkorange;">Petra, Jordan:</h3>
    <font size="4"><p>Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan, is also known as the ‘rose city’ for its golden hue.
         It dates as far back as 312 BCE. Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab Nabataeans,
          a sophisticated civilization that carved stunning architecture and complex waterways out of surrounding rock 
          faces. The Nabateans also established Petra as a successful trade hub, earning vast wealth and 
          a booming population before being wiped out by earthquakes. Unknown to the Western world for centuries, 
          the city was uncovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. 19th-century poet and scholar 
          John William Burgon described Petra as “a rose-red city half as old as time.

    <font size="4"><p>Of course, the impressive research carried out by the New 7 
        Wonders Foundation would never have happened if it weren’t for the original list of the
         Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Ancient travelers of the Hellenistic Era made notes 
         on the incredible architectural achievements they encountered along the way, which they believed 
         represented the pinnacle of human imagination and achievement.
         Various lists of wonders materialized from their research, 
         but the most celebrated and famous was compiled by Antipater of Sidon (2nd-1st century BCE). 
         His list, put together in poetry form, was as follows: The Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
          the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes, 
          and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Of this list, only one still remains standing: the Great Pyramid of Giza, 
          completed more than 4,000 years ago. While it might seem arbitrary today,
           the number seven was of great significance to the ancient Greeks,
            who saw it as the true embodiment of perfection.</p></font>
