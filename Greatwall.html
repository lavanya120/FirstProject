    <h2>1. Does The Great Wall Of China Actually Exist? </h2>
    <font size="4"> <p>
    Though the wall system stretching across Northern China is tangible architecture, the question of the existence of the “Great Wall”
    as understood today is a less straightforward one. 
    The first accounts of the Great Wall of China as a unified structure, come from Western missionaries during 
    the 17th century. To the surprise of Chinese officials that accompanied them, Europeans who made their way to 
    Beijing were most impressed by the newly built Ming Walls that surrounded the capital, wanting to spend a great 
    deal of time and ink on them. They had probably heard about the legendary wall that during the Han dynasty extended
     from the Gobi desert to the Gulf of Bohai when they unwittingly assumed the two walls to be one and the same.

    <h2>2.Not Just One Wall, And Maybe Not Great At All </h2>
    <font size="4"> <p>
        Once again, the Great Wall of China may have never been “great” at all. 
        From a linguistic standpoint, there is no proven correspondence between the name “Great Wall” commonly
        used in the West, and the Chinese name Chang cheng 长城, meaning long wall(s).
        The name first appeared in Sima Qian’s “Record of the Grand Historian” in 94 BC, 
        as a quick mention to describe the system of defensive walls built during the Warring States period (475-221 BC),
        and later unified under the first emperor (259-210 BC). Sima Qian’s early record of a wall
        stretching across Northern China from the Gobi desert in the West, to the Gulf of Bohai in the East, 
        still conditions today’s common understanding of it.
