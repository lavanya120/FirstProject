    <h2>1. A Large Part of the Roman Colosseum Still Stands Today</h2>
   <font size="4"> <p>It seems incredible that the Roman Colosseum is still standing today,
       given that Romans constructed this great monument nearly 2,000 years ago.
       Throughout time, the city of Rome has undergone dramatic periods of transformation,
    yet the Colosseum has remained the one constant, unmoving reminder of its past.
    Parts of the Roman Colosseum were plundered and stripped of materials by looters, and it has also suffered as a result of earthquakes. 
    But even so, one third of the original building survives, enough to give a flavor of how dramatic and theatrical it once was.</p></font>

    <h2>2. It Was a Stage for Gladiatorial Fights</h2>
<font size="4"><p>The Roman Colosseum was once the place where many thousands of Romans would gather to watch brutal gladiatorial fights,
     sports and a range of other violent, action-packed and gruesome activities that often ended in bloodshed and death. 
     Romans sometimes even flooded the amphitheater and organized mini naval ship battles inside to a captive audience.

<h2>3. The Roman Colosseum Is a Marvel of Architectural Innovation</h2>
<font size="4"><p>The Roman Colosseum is a true marvel of architectural innovation. 
    It was unique in its day because it was constructed in an oval, rather than a circular,shape, allowing 
    audience members a better view of the action. The Roman Colosseum was also the largest amphitheater of the ancient world, stretching over 6 acres of land.
